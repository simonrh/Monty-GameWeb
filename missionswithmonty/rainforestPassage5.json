As little as 0.3% of all freshwater on Earth is available in rivers, lakes, streams, and groundwater. Some plants and animals can only use freshwater. They cannot drink or absorb saltwater safely. So they have access to only a small portion of all water. Trout are an example of freshwater fish. They live in freshwater lakes and rivers.",

      "text": "In addition to needing the right type of water, organisms are impacted by the quality of water. Water quality is a way to describe how 'healthy' the water is for living organisms. Organisms living in water need gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide to survive. These gases are dissolved or mixed into the water. Sometimes water does not have enough dissolved gases for animals and plants to survive. The amount of dissolved gas in the water is one way we can measure water quality. There are other characteristics of water that are used to describe water quality, such as pollutants in the water.",
