Pollutants can also come from factories and farms. Wastewater from factories is drained into water sources. Chemicals used in farming, like pesticides and fertilizers, mix with groundwater in the soil. Groundwater and rainwater drain into nearby bodies of water. This water is called runoff. Runoff can carry dangerous chemicals like fertilizers from the soil into bodies of water. Trash like plastic bottles and straws are also water pollutants.",

      "text": "Water pollutants can hurt and kill organisms that depend on water for their survival. Eutrophication is one example of water pollution. Eutrophication occurs when there are too many nutrients in the water. Plants need nutrients to grow. But too many nutrients can be very harmful. There needs to be a balance of nutrients available in the ecosystem. When large amounts of nutrients get into water, plants grow too quickly. Algae, for example, grows quickly when there are too many nutrients. The extra algae block sunlight from other plants growing in the water. When there are too many algae, they begin to compete for resources. The algae begin to die very quickly. As the dead algae decompose, there is not enough oxygen left in the water. Fish and other water animals who need the oxygen also begin to die. Eutrophication creates a dead zone in the water where nothing can survive.",
