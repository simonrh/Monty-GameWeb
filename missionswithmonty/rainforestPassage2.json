Aquatic animals have adaptations that help them survive in water. Adaptations help organisms survive in their environment. For example, some aquatic animals can breathe in the water. Other aquatic animals come to the surface of the water to breathe. These animals can hold their breath for a long time.",

These sharks eat food as small as plankton. On the other hand, the whale shark can grow as long as 60 ft. This is longer than a bus. Some large sharks eat other animals as big as sea lions. These sharks are at the top of the ocean food chain.",
