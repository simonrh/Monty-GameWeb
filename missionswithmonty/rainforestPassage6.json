Sometimes water does not have enough dissolved gases. When this happens, organisms do not have the gases they need to survive. Animals may be able to move to a new area to get the oxygen they need. Plants, however, are not able to move on their own and may die from a lack of carbon dioxide. Healthy water has balanced levels of dissolved gases.",

Animals need healthy water to drink. Acidic water can cause plants to die if they are not used to it. It can also damage aquatic animals by hurting their skin, eyes, or other parts of their body. Pollution can make water more acidic. For example, air pollution mixes with rain to cause acid rain. When acid rain falls to Earth, it mixes with bodies of water and makes the water acidic. ",

Pesticides, or chemicals that kill insects, are especially dangerous to small organisms in the water, like snails. When water insects die, fish, birds, and other organisms do not have enough food to survive.",

For example, some plants grow best when they have a certain amount of nitrogen in the soil. If this amount of nitrogen becomes too low, the plant does not grow well. Changes to the balance of elements can also cause some plants to grow more. This can lead to one plant taking over an entire area. For example, algae can take over a lake when the nitrogen level in the lake is high. This unnatural increase in algae is called an algae bloom.",

Pollutants lower water quality but organisms adapt easily. For example, when the amount of elements changes, organisms adapt."
