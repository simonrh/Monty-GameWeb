Some of the trash is biodegradable, like food scraps and paper. Biodegradable means the trash breaks down into organic matter very quickly. Unfortunately, a lot of trash in landfills is not biodegradable. Plastic items, batteries, and soda cans are not biodegradable. Solid waste that isn't biodegradable is harmful to the environment because it takes years to break down and may leak toxic chemicals into the soil.",

      "text": "Land pollution also occurs when chemicals are added to the soil. Farmers often use pesticides and fertilizers to protect their crops. Unfortunately, most of these chemicals remain in the soil for many years. Pesticides and fertilizers can hurt organisms living in the soil such as insects and worms. The chemicals can also mix with water in the soil. When the water drains from the soil it is called runoff. Runoff containing fertilizers and other pollutants enters into rivers and lakes causing water pollution, which harms aquatic animals like fish and frogs.",

      "text": "Deforestation can also destroy land. Deforestation is the cutting down of acres of trees. Trees are cut down to make paper and furniture. Trees are also cut down to clear land to build roads, farms, houses, and other things humans use. Deforestation destroys habitats for animals and plants. Animals are then forced to move to survive. Deforestation also leads to erosion or the wearing away of the top layer of soil. When erosion occurs it is difficult for new plants to grow in these areas.",
