      "text": "Coral are small invertebrate animals. Invertebrate means they do not have a backbone. Individual coral are very small, sometimes only a few millimeters in width. Coral live together in large colonies called coral reefs. Coral reefs can be very large. A famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, which is more than 1,200 miles long. Coral reefs are found near the shore in tropical oceans. The Great Barrier Reef is found off the north-east coast of Australia. A reef is made of layers of calcium carbonate that the coral deposit to build their home. When coral die the reef is left behind. New coral then build on the existing reef making it grow. Coral reefs are important to their ecosystem because they attract many other living organisms. Coral reefs make up only 1% of the ocean floor but they attract 25% of all ocean life.",

They depend on the water to bring fresh food every day. Living in shallow water near the shore gives them access to steadily-moving water to deliver this food. Coral use their tentacles to catch food in the water. They also use their tentacles to defend themselves against predators. Coral collect calcium from the moving water to build the reef.",

Toxic pollutants in the water can cause great damage to the coral reefs by killing coral and other organisms that live on reefs. Sometimes humans also break off pieces of the reef. This kills the delicate coral. Coral also cannot move if the temperature of the water becomes too hot. Climate change is causing a rise in the temperature of tropical ocean waters, which is beginning to kill coral.",
