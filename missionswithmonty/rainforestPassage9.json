Plants like ferns and grasses grow along the banks of rivers. Animals from small fish to hippopotamuses swim in the river water. Land animals also rely on river water. For example, warthogs and elephants come to rivers to drink and swim.",

Some pollutants come from factories that release chemicals into bodies of water. They can also come from homes that let their trash or waste run into the water. Water pollution hurts organisms that use the water.",

Pesticides are chemicals that prevent pests like insects or rodents from eating plants. When it rains, pesticides on plants are washed off and mixed with the rain. This drains into the soil. Runoff is the extra water in the soil that drains into nearby bodies of water, like streams and rivers. Runoff from farms can contain pesticides and other dangerous chemicals. Animal waste is another pollutant that becomes part of runoff and enters water sources. Polluted runoff is harmful to organisms that live in water and depend on water for survival.",

Water pollution is also dangerous to animals. Animals can die if they drink polluted water, eat polluted plants, or swim in polluted water. A good example is plastic found in water bodies. Aquatic animals can die if they swallow plastic. These days, plastic particles are found even in the deepest parts of the oceans. ",
