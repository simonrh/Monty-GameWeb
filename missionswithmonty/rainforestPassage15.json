      "text": "Respiration and photosynthesis depend on each other. Respiration and photosynthesis recycle chemicals that the other process needs. Plants and animals exchange gases they need to survive. Plants release the oxygen animals need. Animals then release carbon dioxide which plants need. If animals stopped going through respiration the balance of gases in the air would begin to change. Plants would continue releasing oxygen, but they would eventually run out of carbon dioxide. This would cause the plants to die. Similarly, if plants stopped going through photosynthesis, the level of carbon dioxide in the air would increase. Eventually animals would not have oxygen to use for respiration. This would cause animals to die. When there is an imbalance of gases, living organisms will not have what they need to survive.",

Animals are not able to go through photosynthesis. Plants perform the life-sustaining process of photosynthesis. Without plants, all levels of a food web would run out of food and energy.",

    "middle": "Plants go through photosynthesis and animals go through respiration. These processes provide energy to organisms and produce chemicals for the environment. Organisms wouldn't survive without photosynthesis and respiration. For example, animals wouldn't have oxygen to breathe.",
    "bad": "Photosynthesis is an important process. Plants produce the carbon dioxide and water that animals need. Without photosynthesis, animals wouldn't have carbon dioxide to breathe or water to drink. Animals produce oxygen and glucose through respiration, but photosynthesis is more important."
