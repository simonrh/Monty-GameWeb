      "text": "Temperate and tropical rainforests are two types of rainforests. Both rainforests get heavy rain, have thick vegetation, and have many evergreen trees. Evergreen trees stay green all year. Temperate rainforests are found in the cooler climates of the temperate zones far away from the equator. Trees in temperate rainforests have needle leaves. Tropical rainforests are found near the equator. It is very warm there. Trees in tropical rainforests have broad leaves and can grow up to 90 feet tall. Tropical rainforests receive more rainfall than temperate rainforests. Wildlife University is in a tropical rainforest.",

      "text": "Tropical rainforests are one of the oldest ecosystems on Earth. Tropical rainforests are very warm and rainy. This means they have high humidity. Humidity is the amount of water in the air. High humidity is important. This gives animals and plants a perfect environment to live. Rainforests are rich in biodiversity which means that there are many kinds of plants and animals living there. For example, the canopy is a great home for animals that supports biodiversity. The tops of tall evergreen trees form a dense layer of leaf covering called a canopy. The canopy blocks the sun from the forest floor. Vines from the soil are also part of the canopy. These vines grow up tree trunks and along branches. Two-thirds of the world's plants and animals live in tropical rainforests.",

Tropical rainforests also affect the wind, rain, and temperature of other ecosystems. Unfortunately, rainforests are in danger. One danger is that trees are being cut down in the rainforests. So, plants and animals living in Wildlife University are also in danger. ",
