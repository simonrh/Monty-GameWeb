Animals then eat plants to get energy. Photosynthesis, or the process of making glucose in plants, is required for all living things on earth to survive. But plants need more than just sunlight. Plants also need nutrients. Nutrients are substances that are very important for living organisms to grow, develop, and function properly.",

      "text": "One such nutrient plants need to grow is nitrogen. Nitrogen is an element that is all over the Earth. Nitrogen in the soil mixes with water. Plants then absorb the nitrogen when they absorb water. Plants use nitrogen to grow healthy leaves. Nitrogen is part of chlorophyll, the green chemical inside of plants that absorbs energy from sunlight. Without nitrogen, plants would not be able to survive. In fact, all living organisms need nitrogen. Another nutrient that plants need is phosphorus. Phosphorus is also an element that plants absorb through their roots. Phosphorus is necessary for plants to grow roots and seeds.",

      "text": "Normally, dead plants and animals are decomposed, which causes nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil to be recycled. But if farmers plant crops too often, the nutrients can be used up. So, the soil lacks these essential nutrients, making plants unhealthy. As a result, they do not produce healthy fruits or vegetables. Farmers can add fertilizers to the soil to help plants grow. Fertilizers have lots of nitrogen and phosphorus. Plants can then absorb these nutrients.",
